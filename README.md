# RandomForestClassifier
It is a machine learning algorithm from the scikit-learn library used for classification tasks. It is an ensemble learning method that works by creating multiple decision trees during training and then aggregating their predictions to make the final classification. This technique helps to reduce overfitting and increase the model's accuracy compared to a single decision tree.
#### Demo
Using 'Mode of Entry' for prediction and rest of the columns for training and test split.
#### Metrics
accuracy_score, precision_score, recall_score, f1_score
#### Visualizations
Classification report, Confusion matrix
# K-means
It is a popular clustering algorithm used in unsupervised machine learning. It groups similar data points into a pre-defined number of clusters based on their feature similarities.
#### Demo
Using 'Latitude and Longitude' to predict the clusters with operator 'Type' as label.
#### Metrics
pca, explained_variance_ratio_, inertia_
#### Visualizations
scatterplot
